### Stable Marriage Problem
One O(n^2) solution to the stable marriage problem, with the Gale-Shapley algorithm as a foundation
* The script says that every test passed. After doing some runs with the largest test set it avreages a total run time of about 5-6 seconds and performs the algorithm in around 1/20th of a second. Preprocessing the data seems to take the most amount of time in this case and the algorithm itself is pretty fast. All measurements were done using the time module with the time.perf_counter_ns() method.
* We implemented the soultion using the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable marriages, as instructed, with a total time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
